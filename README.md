## Introduction
This is my portfolio website that I intend on sending to potential employers to serve as a centralized place to showcase some of my 
skills and projects. I added animations to the skills section and the resume section to show that I am capable of styling / programming on-scroll animations. I also used some Bootstrap for the navbar and the projects carousel to show that I understand how Bootstrap classes work.

## Breakdown

### Introduction Section
This section essentially serves as a cover letter where I give a brief introduction about my programming journey and then try to sell 
myself as a potential employee.

### Skills Section
This section uses icons to display what technologies I have experience with. They animate from left to right when 2/3 of the image is on-screen. They also animate off the screen when less than 2/3 is showing, although that is a much more subtle effect. When animating on-screen, the animation is delayed in order to create a staggered effect.

### Projects Section
This section features a carousel that will house any projects that I want to showcase. The code is easy to duplicate so I will just add more projects to the carousel as I complete them.

### Resume Section
This section holds the 'work experience' portion of my resume. Like the skills section, the jobs appear when 2/3 is on-screen. The icons animate in from the left and the job description animates in from the right until they meet in the middle. This was initally set to trigger when 1/2 was on screen but created readability issues when viewed on a mobile device.
