        <h1>I'm Tyler,</h1>
        <h2>an aspiring web developer</h2>
        <p>I've decided to perform a career change and move into web development. My journey started with learning Python because 
            it was the language that everyone recommended learning first. I believe I took to it quite well, I enjoyed the easy to 
            understand syntax. Once I was competent in Python I began researching what career path I should take with it. This 
            eventually lead me to web development where I reprioritized my learning into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There was a 
            small learning curve transitioning from Python to JavaScript but overall it felt pretty familiar. Currently, I'm working 
            on honing my front-end skills and plan to enter the industry as a front-end developer. I will then continue my learning 
            into back-end with the eventual goal being full-stack development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I typically learn things at an accelerated rate which I believe is an invaluable skill to have in the tech industry. With 
            my governmental / investigatory job experience, you can rest assured that I will bring the utmost level of professionalism 
            to any position. I have leadership experience so I know how to get along with, guide, and manage others. I've corresponded with 
            federal, local, and tribal governments so I'm well spoken / written. I've worked law / regulatory enforcement positions so 
            I know how to operate in high stress environments. Overall, I think I would be a valuable asset to any team and look forward 
            to growing with your company.
        </p>
        <h3>Thank you</h3>
